# How should we relate to apologetic strategies that emphasize chronological alignment between the Bible and science versus strategies of meaning alignment?

## Short Answer

Apologetic strategies focused on chronological alignment (concordism) try to make the Bible match modern scientific chronology, while meaning alignment (perspectivalism) emphasizes the theological truths of Scripture without requiring scientific concordance. The latter approach is more robust as it avoids constant revisions when new scientific discoveries emerge.

## In-Depth Answer

### Theological Perspective

From a theological perspective, the Bible's primary purpose is to reveal God's relationship with humanity and His redemptive plan, not to serve as a scientific textbook. As discussed in various hermeneutical approaches, the creation accounts in Genesis primarily convey theological truths about God as Creator, the goodness of creation, and humanity's unique role as bearing God's image.

The concordist approach, which seeks to align biblical texts with scientific discoveries, has several weaknesses:

1. It requires constant revision as new scientific findings emerge
2. It can place God in the "God of the gaps" position, where divine action is relegated to areas science hasn't yet explained
3. It conflates ancient cosmology with modern scientific understanding

Perspectivalism, on the other hand, acknowledges that biblical authors described natural phenomena from their observational perspective (e.g., speaking of the sun "rising" or describing the cosmos as having "waters above" the sky), without necessarily endorsing the cosmological models of their time as scientifically accurate. This approach separates the theological message from the ancient cosmological "vessel" in which it was communicated.

For example, when Jesus spoke of mustard seeds being the smallest of all seeds (Matthew 13:32), He was using a common understanding of His time to convey a spiritual truth, not making an objective scientific statement. Similarly, biblical authors used their ancient understanding of the world to communicate transcendent truths about God's sovereignty.

### Scientific Perspective

From a scientific perspective, the pursuit of chronological alignment between Scripture and scientific discoveries often leads to increasingly complex interpretations that become outdated as science advances. The history of Christian engagement with science, such as the Galileo affair, shows that tying biblical interpretation too closely to contemporary scientific models or trying to extract modern science from Scripture can be problematic.

Science operates with methodological naturalism to understand the natural world through empirical observation and experimentation. This approach has yielded reliable knowledge about the age of the earth, evolutionary processes, and the development of life forms. Rather than viewing these findings as contrary to faith, they can be seen as revealing the methods God used in His creative work.

The perspectival approach allows for accepting scientific findings about the age of the earth, the evolutionary development of life, and the deep geological time without compromising the theological truths of Scripture. This approach recognizes that God chose to communicate His truth through human authors using their language, culture, and understanding of the world.

The scientific evidence for the age of the earth and evolutionary development is overwhelming, and trying to force the biblical text to provide an alternative scientific account often leads to increasingly untenable positions. Instead, the theological meaning of the creation account can be preserved without requiring it to provide a scientifically accurate account of the mechanisms of creation.

Theological truth and scientific understanding address different types of questions: Scripture speaks to *why* and *for what purpose* creation exists, while science addresses *how* it works. Both approaches can coexist without conflict when we recognize their different domains of authority and purpose.
